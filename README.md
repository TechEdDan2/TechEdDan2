<summary><h3> ðŸš¶ My Path So Far </h3></summary>
With my over 15 years of working in education, 13 of which have been spent with my current employer, I have achieved a number of personal and professional goals, including building a Technology Education and Computer Science Department from the ground up. I have also spent a portion of that time in IT Support. During my tenure, I have utilized my Masters of Information Science degree as well as independent learning to develop and teach various computer science courses offered at the high school level, personally shaping the department's curriculum. Those courses have included Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, Website Design and Development, IB Digital Society, Robotics, and iOS App Development. Instructing these courses has allowed me to explore various coding languages, CAD, multimedia editing, educational technology tools, and hardware. This curiostity also led me to start a Robotics program at my current school to complete in the yearly FIRST Tech Challenge. All of these have helped fuel my love of learning and growing my technical skills. Right now in my life I am looking for new challenges, including diving more deeply into software development to create not just teach. As a starting step in this direction, I am completing Stony Brook University's Software Engineering Certificate Bootcamp. This is a challenge being a full-time teacher and completing a 9 month bootcamp, but I am excited to continue on my coding journey.
