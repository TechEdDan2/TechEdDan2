**Technology Educator | FIRST Tech Challenge Coach | Hobbyist Maker | Developer | Life Long Learner**

- 🤖 Professionally, I am currently teaching high school level technology education and computer science courses, as well as mentoring robotics teams that compete in the yearly FIRST Tech Challenge competition.
- 🌱 My curiosity in technology started in middle school when I got my first Windows desktop computer, but I only dabbled in exploring this interest here and there. I completed a couple computer science courses in primary school and college, but didn't major in comp sci. After I completed my master's degree in Library and Information Science, is when I started to pursue learning more coding languages on my own, like Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, and simpler block-based languages as well. To level up my skills, I’m currently completing a Software Engineering Bootcamp.  
- 🤔 Here on GitHub I’m looking to gain more knowledge of Full Stack Development and seeing where it takes me personally and professionally

<summary><h3> 🚶 More About Me and My Path </h3></summary>
With over 15 years of working in education, I have achieved a number of personal and professional goals, including building a Technology Education and Computer Science Department from the ground up. I spent a portion of my professional career in IT Support and Library Services, responding to the needs of my colleagues and students, and then pivoted to the classroom to teach full time. During my tenure, I have utilized my Masters of Information Science degree as well as independent learning to develop and guide learners through various computer science courses offered at the High School and Middle School levels, personally shaping the department's curriculum. Those courses have included Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, Website Design and Development, IB Digital Society, (FIRST Tech Challenge) Robotics, iOS App Development, LEGO Robotics, and Digital Literacy and Citizenship. Instructing these courses has allowed me to explore various coding languages, CAD, multimedia editing, educational technology tools, and many types of hardware. One of the most impactful educational explorations led me to start a Robotics program at my current school to compete in the yearly FIRST Tech Challenge competition. All of these experiences helped fuel my love of learning and helped me to grow my technical skills. Right now, I am looking for new challenges, including diving more deeply into software development to create, not just teach. As a step in this direction, I am completing Stony Brook University's Software Engineering Certificate Bootcamp. It is challenging balancing being a full-time teacher and completing an intensive bootcamp, but I am excited to continue my coding journey.
