<summary><h3> ðŸš¶ My Path So Far </h3></summary>
With over 15 years of working in education, I have achieved a number of personal and professional goals, including building a Technology Education and Computer Science Department from the ground up. I spent a portion of my professional career in IT Support and Library Services, responding to the needs of my colleagues and students. During my tenure, I have utilized my Masters of Information Science degree as well as independent learning to develop and teach various computer science courses offered at the High School and Middle School levels, personally shaping the department's curriculum. Those courses have included Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, Website Design and Development, IB Digital Society, Robotics, iOS App Development, LEGO Robotics, and Digital Literacy and Citizenship. Instructing these courses has allowed me to explore various coding languages, CAD, multimedia editing, educational technology tools, and hardware. One of the most impactful educational explorations led me to start a Robotics program at my current school to compete in the yearly FIRST Tech Challenge. All of these experiences helped fuel my love of learning and helped me to grow my technical skills. Right now, I am looking for new challenges, including diving more deeply into software development to create, not just teach. As a step in this direction, I am completing Stony Brook University's Software Engineering Certificate Bootcamp. It is challenging being a full-time teacher and completing an intensive bootcamp, but I am excited to continue my coding journey.
